# Matrix-calculator
A simple Matrix Calculator built using Python and NumPy. Supports addition, multiplication, transpose, and determinant operations through a console interface.
This is a simple matrix calculator I built using Python and NumPy. It runs in the terminal and lets you do basic matrix operations like:

- Adding two matrices
- Multiplying two matrices
- Transposing a matrix
- Finding the determinant
- Finding rank
- Finding inverse

Itâ€™s a small project I made while learning NumPy, just to practice and understand how matrix operations work in code.
